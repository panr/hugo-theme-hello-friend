# Hello Friend

![Hello Friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend/blob/master/images/screenshot.png?raw=true)

This theme was made to help you present your ideas easier. We all know how hard is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure them and when thatâ€™s done â€” create the content.

This theme is pretty basic and covers all of the essentials. All you have to do is start typing!

#### Built-in shortcodes

- **`image`** (prop required: **`src`**; props optional: **`alt`**, **`position`** (**left** is default | center | right), **`style`**)
  - eg: `{{< image src="/img/hello.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}`
- **`figure`** (same as `image`, plus few optional props: **`caption`**, **`captionPosition`** (left | **center** is default | right), **`captionStyle`**
  - eg: `{{< figure src="/img/hello.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Hello Friend!" captionPosition="right" captionStyle="color: red;" >}}`
- **`imgproc`** Hugo shortcode for image processing. More info at [https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/](https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/)

#### Code highlighting

## How to start

You can download the theme manually by going to [https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend.git](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend.git) and pasting it to `themes/hello-friend` in your root directory.

You can also clone it directly to your Hugo folder:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend.git themes/hello-friend
```

If you don't want to make any radical changes, it's the best option, because you can get new updates when they are available. To do so, include it as a git submodule:

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend.git themes/hello-friend
```

## How to configure

The theme doesn't require any advanced configuration. Just copy:

```
baseurl = "/"
languageCode = "en-us"
theme = "hello-friend"
paginate = 5

[params]
  # dir name of your blog content (default is `content/posts`)
  contentTypeName = "posts"
  # "light" or "dark"
  defaultTheme = "dark"
  # if you set this to 0, only submenu trigger will be visible
  showMenuItems = 2
  # Show reading time in minutes for posts
  showReadingTime = false

[languages]
  [languages.en]
    title = "Hello Friend"
    subtitle = "A simple theme for Hugo"
    keywords = ""
    copyright = ""
    menuMore = "Show more"
    writtenBy = "Written by"
    readMore = "Read more"
    readOtherPosts = "Read other posts"
    newerPosts = "Newer posts"
    olderPosts = "Older posts"
    minuteReadingTime = "min read"
    dateFormatSingle = "2006-01-02"
    dateFormatList = "2006-01-02"

    [languages.en.params.logo]
      logoText = "hello friend"
      logoHomeLink = "/"
    # or
    #
    # path = "/img/your-example-logo.svg"
    # alt = "Your example logo alt text"

    [languages.en.menu]
      [[languages.en.menu.main]]
        identifier = "about"
        name = "About"
        url = "/about"
      [[languages.en.menu.main]]
        identifier = "showcase"
        name = "Showcase"
        url = "/showcase"
```

to `config.toml` file in your Hugo root directory and change params fields. In case you need, here's [a YAML version](https://gist.github.com/panr/8f9b363e358aaa33f6d353c77feee959).

**NOTE:** Please keep in mind that currently main menu doesn't support nesting.

## How to add a cover image to your posts

Adding a cover image to your post is simple and there are two options when you edit your `index.md` file in `content/posts/blog-entry-xy/index.md`:

* Use `cover = "/path/to/absolute/img.jpg"` to link an absolute image
  * Resulting in `https://www.yourpage.com/path/to/absolute/img.jpg`
* Use `cover = "img.jpg"` and `useRelativeCover = true` to link the image relative to the blog post folder
  * Resulting in `https://www.yourpage.com/posts/blog-entry-xy/img.jpg`

## Add-ons

- **Archive** â€” Theme has built-in `archive` page for main content (see `contentTypeName` variable in config). If you need archive on your blog just copy https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend/blob/master/exampleSite/content/archive.md to your `content` dir. If you need multilangual archives, duplicate `content/archive.md` and add `.Lang` variable, eg: `content/archive.pl.md` (remember to change `url` in duplicated file).
- **Comments** â€” for adding comments to your blog posts please take a look at `layouts/partials/comments.html` https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/blob/master/layouts/partials/comments.html.
- **Prepended `<head>`** â€” if you need to add something inside `<head>` element, and before any of the theme's `<script>` and `<link>` tags are declared, please take a look at `layouts/partial/prepended_head.html` https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend/blob/master/layouts/partials/prepended_head.html
- **Extended `<head>`** â€” if you need to add something inside `<head>` element, after all of all of the theme's `<script>` and `<link>` tags are declared, please take a look at `layouts/partial/extended_head.html` https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend/blob/master/layouts/partials/extended_head.html
- **Extended `<footer>`** â€” if you need to add something before end of `<body>` element, please take a look at `layouts/partial/extended_footer.html` https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend/blob/master/layouts/partials/extended_footer.html

## How to run your site

From your Hugo root directory run:

```
$ hugo server -t hello-friend
```

and go to `localhost:1313` in your browser. From now on all the changes you make will go live, so you don't need to refresh your browser every single time.

## How to edit the theme

If you have to override some of the styles, you can do this easily by adding `static/style.css` in your root directory and point things you want to change.

Otherwise, if you really want to edit the theme, you need to install Node dependencies. To do so, go to the theme directory (from your Hugo root directory):

```
$ cd themes/hello-friend
```

and then run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm i yarn
$ yarn
```
